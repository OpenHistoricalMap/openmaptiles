layer:
  id: "boundary"
  description: |
      Contains administrative boundaries (no maritime boundaries yet) as polygons.
      OSM data contains all [`admin_level`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative#admin_level)
      but for most styles it makes sense to just style `admin_level=2` and `admin_level=4`.
  fields:
    admin_level: |
        OSM [admin_level](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative#admin_level)
        indicating the level of importance of this boundary.
    disputed:
      description: |
          Mark with `1` if the border is disputed.
      values: [0, 1]
    maritime:
      description: |
          Mark with `1` if it is a maritime border.
      values: [0, 1]
